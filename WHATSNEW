							| FAUST 0.9.30 |
							================

GRAME - Centre National de Creation Musicale - is happy to announce
the release of FAUST 0.9.30. This version fixes several bugs,
introduces some new possibilities in the language and provides 
improved libraries and additional examples, as well as simplification 
of block diagram by removing useless cables

About FAUST :
-------------

FAUST (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming
language specifically designed for real-time signal processing and
synthesis. A distinctive characteristic of FAUST is to be fully
compiled. The FAUST compiler translates DSP specifications into
very efficient C++ code that works at sample level. It targets
high-performance signal processing applications, libraries and
audio plug-ins for a variety of audio platforms and standards. A
same FAUST specification can be used to easily generate native
JACK or ALSA applications, as well as CSOUND, LADSPA, MAX/MSP, PD,
Q, SC and VST plugins.  

The Faust distribution can be downloaded at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/faudiostream

We switched from CVS to GIT. The GIT repository can be cloned with 
the following command :
git clone git://faudiostream.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/faudiostream/faudiostream faust

Two mailing lists are available:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/faudiostream-devel
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/faudiostream-users

In order to test FAUST without installing it, please refer to the
Online Faust Compiler (requires firefox):

======================== WHAT'S NEW ==============================

---------------
Documentation :
---------------

- A new version of the Faust Quick Reference is provided with a
better layout and an expanded and updated content.
=======
------------
What's new :
------------
Examples :

- smoothdelay.dsp
- cubic_distortion.dsp
- gate_compressor.dsp
- graphic_eq.dsp
- parametric_eq.dsp
- phaser_flanger.dsp
- spectral_level.dsp
- vcf_wah_pedals.dsp

Documentation :

- Updated and improved faust quick reference

libraries :

- music.lib : added sdelay() function for variable delays without transposition

- math.lib : interpolate(a,b,i) and if(c,t,e)

- filter.lib : added function fir() for general convolution based FIR filtering
			 : added allpass_comb filter

- effet.lib : historical reverberators (originaly implemented by John Chowning
in the MUS10) jcrev, satrev, and reverb_demo in effect.lib

Architectures :

- fix for supercollider.cpp architecture file

- Aggregate in/out devices when needed ca-qt.cpp (core audio QT) architecture file

Compiler :

- fix error message for non constant-integer table sizes

- getBoxType now always called on fully evaluated expressions in PNF (propagation normal form)

- missing boxtype for pattern matching variables added

Language definition :


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improved mathematical description (--mathdoc option) and support
for two new languages : German (-mdlang de) and Italian (-mdlang
it)

- Support for floating point numbers in scientific notation and
better precision for floating point constants. The precision used
to print a floating point constant in the generated C++ code is no
more limited to 6 digits. It is now dynamically adjusted to find
the minimal number of digits that will produce the same internal
representation when read back. This approach guarantees accuracy
without sacrificing for readability.

- All expressions are now systematically represented in polynomial
forms. For example x*x will be replaced by x^2. If x is a complex
expression the later form has several advantages, in particular to
limit CSE.

- Lazy semantics to select2 and select3 : the code generated for
select2 and select3 is now based on conditional expressions
((cond)?exp1:exp0 ) instead of tables. The resulting code is more
efficient as the stateless parts of the branches are not computed
every time but only when really needed.

- new --task-graph option. It produces a graphical representation
of the internal DAG of task in dot format (Graphviz
http://www.graphviz.org/). This DAG is useful for example to
understand the potential parallelism of a program as analyzed by
the Faust compiler

- Two new tools : faust2graph and faust2graphviewer. These tools
make use of the --task-graph option in order to produce the
graphical representation, as a PDF file, of the internal DAG of
tasks of a Faust program (require Graphviz).

- new reduce.lib library. It provides various operations on block
of samples based on a high order 'reduce(op, n)' fold-like
function. Moreover the music.lib library has been extended with
break-point functions and multiple decorrelated random and noise
generators. New flanger and stereowidth control have been added to
the effect.lib library.

- new iPhone architecture. It consists in a iphone-cocoa.cpp
architecture file and an Xcode template project to be used to
produce the applications. Use "make iphone" in the example folder
to build the examples for the iPhone.

- improved cross plateform compatibility and brand new visual
studio 2008 project to build Faust on windows machines.

----------
Compiler :
----------

- the ':' (seq), '<:' (split), ':>' (merge) and ',' (par)
composition operators are now right associative. For example the
parallel composition (1,2,3,4,5) now denotes (1,(2,(3,(4,5)))).
This change simplifies pattern matching techniques in particular
the use parallel compositions as lists. The iterative par(...)
construction as been modified accordingly.

- Improved pattern matching support. Variables don't have anymore
to be undefined to be considered match variables. The new strategy
uses the positions to determine the role of variables. For example
in pattern 'x(y,z)' y and z are match variables while x, in
functional position, is a regular variable. This allow to evaluate
patterns without having to introduce a special notation for match
variables...


-----------
Libraries :
-----------

The various libraries have been extended, in particular Julius
Smith's effect.lib, osc.lib and filter.lib. 

- effect.lib : among the new additions are some historical reverbs
form the early 70's like John Chowning's jcrev and satrev. 

- filter.lib : contains several new filters in particular
third-order and sixth-order Elliptic/Cauer lowpass and highpass
filters. 

- math.lib : added Hadamard() matrix function contributed by RÃ©my
Muller that has applications in Feedback Delay Networks.


----------
Examples :
----------
Several examples were added to illustrate some of the new functions
provided by the libraries.

- cubic_distortion.dsp, 

- gate_compressor.dsp,

- graphic_eq.dsp,
 
- parametric_eq.dsp, 

- phaser_flanger.dsp

- smoothdelay.dsp, 

- spectral_level.dsp, 

- vcf_wah_pedals.dsp


--------------------
Architecture files :
--------------------

- ca-qt.cpp : Aggregate in/out devices when needed.

- jack-gtk.cpp : Tooltip format added

- max-msp.cpp : help message is now posted even when no audio inlet
is available

- module.cpp : updated 

- supercollider.cpp : compile fix 


----------
Bug Fixes:
----------

- improved error messages for non constant-integer table sizes

- getBoxType now only always called on fully evaluated expressions
in propagation normal form.

- missing boxtype for pattern matching variables added

- Bitmask : new implementation correcting bug for large values

- some recursive call to simplify have been removed to avoid
potential infinite loops during the simplification of some
expressions
