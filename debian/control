Description: functional programming language for realtime audio applications
 Faust is a functional programming language specifically designed for realtime
 audio applications and plugins. The syntax of the language is block diagram
 oriented. The faust compiler translates signal processing specifications into
 optimized C++ code for signal processing applications.
 .
 The generated code can be wrapped into an 'architecture file' in order to
 create for example a standalone jack/gtk application. Several architecture
 files are provided and additional ones are fairly easy to add.
 .
 This is the development version of Faust, a.k.a. Faust2, which is available
 in the faust2 branch of the Faust git repository. Faust2 offers additional
 code generation backends and architectures for C, Java, JavaScript and LLVM
 bitcode.
